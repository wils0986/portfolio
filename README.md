# Jenny's Design Portfolio 2025

I created this portfolio website using **HTML** and **CSS**. I started by creating the basic **HTML** structure and adding my content, then I proceeded to add **CSS**. I find the work flow most efficient when I start with the "foundation", rather than starting on the "wallpaper". From there, I make sure my **HTML** is semantically correct and valid, after which I finally move on to styling with **CSS** (the best part!).

I used **CSS** to give the website it's colours, fonts, layout, and responsive design. The website is optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens. The site is also built to be accessible without use of a mouse, by using skip links with the Tab key.
