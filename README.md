# Jenny's Portfolio - 2025 #

This portfolio website was built to be fully responsive across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. It’s developed with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

My development process begins with crafting a clean and accessible **HTML** structure. I then apply **CSS** to build responsive layouts and visual styles. With the core structure and styling in place, I use **JavaScript** to add custom interactivity and animations, enhancing the user experience with subtle yet engaging effects.

Accessibility is vital, so I always make sure to implement semantic **HTML** elements, ARIA attributes, and skip links to make the site navigable and inclusive for all users. I also ensure that colour contrast throughout the site meets WCAG accessibility standards, so content remains usable to people with visual impairments. I also take pride in having valid code, so I always run my final code through the W3C Markup and **CSS** Validation Services, and JSHint.
