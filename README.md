# Jenny's Design Portfolio - 2025 #

This portfolio website was built to be fully responsive across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. Itâ€™s developed with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, utilizing **fullPage.js (v4)** providing smooth, scroll-based transitions on desktop screens.

My development process begins with crafting a clean and accessible **HTML** structure. Early in the layout phase, I integrate **FullPage.js v4** to define section-based navigation and scrolling behavior, which helps guide the overall page structure. I then apply **CSS** to build responsive layouts and visual styles around this framework. With the core structure and navigation in place, I use **JavaScript** to add custom interactivity and animations, enhancing the user experience with subtle yet engaging effects.

Accessibility is paramount, so I always make sure to implement semantic **HTML** elements, ARIA attributes, and skip links to make the site navigable and inclusive for all users. I also ensure that colour contrast throughout the site meets WCAG accessibility standards, so content remains readable and accessible to users with visual impairments.
