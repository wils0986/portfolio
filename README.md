# Jenny's Design Portfolio - 2025

I built this portfolio website to be fully responsive across all device types—mobile, tablet, and desktop. It’s developed using **HTML**, **CSS**, and a touch of **JavaScript**, including **fullPage.js (v4)** for smooth, scroll-based transitions.

My workflow begins with laying a solid foundation: I started by structuring the content with semantic, valid **HTML**, followed by styling with **CSS**. I find this bottom-up approach more effective than jumping straight to the visual "wallpaper." Once the layout and styling were in place, I added interactive elements and subtle animations using **JavaScript**, the best part! 

Accessibility was a priority throughout the build. I incorporated semantic tags, ARIA labels, and skip links to ensure the site is navigable and usable for all users.
