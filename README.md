# Jenny's Design Portfolio - 2025

I created this portfolio website using a mobile first approach. The languages included being **HTML**, **CSS**, and a little bit of **JS**. I began by creating the basic **HTML** structure and adding my content, then I proceeded with **CSS** for styling. I find the work flow most efficient when I start with the "foundation", rather than starting on the "wallpaper". From there, I made sure my **HTML** was semantically correct and valid, after which I finally move on to styling with **CSS** (the best part!). Finally, I added some extra funtionality with **JS**.

This website is optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens. The site is built to be accessible to all users, by utilizing the correct tags, skip links, and ARIA labels.
