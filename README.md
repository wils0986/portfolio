# Jenny's Design Portfolio - 2025

This portfolio website was built to be fully responsive across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. Itâ€™s developed using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, with **fullPage.js (v4)** providing smooth, scroll-based transitions on desktop screens.

My development process begins with a strong foundation: I structured the content using semantic, standards-compliant **HTML**, then layered in **CSS** for layout and styling. I prefer this bottom-up approach to ensure the content and structure are sound before refining the visual design. Once the base was in place, I introduced **JavaScript** to add interactivity and subtle motion effects, the best part!

Accessibility was a key focus throughout the build. I implemented semantic **HTML** elements, ARIA attributes, and skip links to make the site navigable and inclusive for all users.
